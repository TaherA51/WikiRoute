# Project WikiRoute

This project is a hybrid Python + C++ system for exploring Wikipedia's top 100k ranked pages as a graph. It lets you analyze connections between articles, run shortest-path algorithms (like Dijkstra’s and Dial’s), and compare algorithm runtime stats in detail using a Streamlit based UI.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TaherA51/streamlit_DSAFINAL_deploy.git
cd wiki-pathfinder
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Change Directories if Needed

If you are running from the command prompt, change directories to the appropriate location with:

```bash
cd wiki-pathfinder
```

### 4. Launch the Streamlit App

Start the UI with:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This will open a web browser where you can interact with Wikiroute application.
